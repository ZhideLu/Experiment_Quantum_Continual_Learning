# Description for this folder:


## functions:
We define some functions to be used in the subsequent simulation.

## dataset: 
We provide three datasets in this folder, including the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits "0" and "9"), the Fashion MNIST dataset ("T-shirts" and "ankle boot"), and the medical dataset ("Hand" and "Breast").

## demo_for_catastrophic_forgetting&quantum_continual_learning:
We provide numerical simulations to demonstrate catastrophic forgetting in quantum learning. To overcome this problem, we exploit the elastic weight consolidation strategy and show that quantum continual learning can be realized. The numerical results are exhibited in Supplementary Sec.IB (Supplementary Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.5, Supplementary Fig.6).


## demo_for_FFNN_learning_engineered_quantum&classical_tasks:

We provide a numerical simulation of continually learning the quantum engineered task and the classical task using classical feedforward neural networks.
The numerical results is exhibited in Fig.3(d) in the main text.
